# This is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
print ("hello")
# First, we define a function called "main"
def main():
    # Inside the main function, we use the print function to print the string "Hello, World!"
    print("Hello, World!")

# Finally, we call the main function to run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
